## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to the programming exercises from the **"Python Programming Course (Introductory to Advanced)"** on Maktabkhooneh, instructed by the amazing [Jadi Mirmirani](https://github.com/jadijadi).

I successfully completed all the exercises and achieved a **perfect score of 100/100** in the course. This collection represents my journey through the fundamentals and more advanced concepts of Python programming as taught in the curriculum.

## Repository Structure & Notation

The repository is organized by exercise number, with each file corresponding to a specific problem from the course.

* **File Notation:**
    * `.py`: Standard Python script files. These can be run directly from the command line.
    * `.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook files, which contain both code and rich text elements (like this README). They are great for exploratory analysis and visualization.

* **How to Use:**
    1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zeynalpour/jadi-python-exercise.git`
    2.  To run `.py` files: `python s03_ex.py`
    3.  To open `.ipynb` files, you'll need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
